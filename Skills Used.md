## Skills and Knowledge Used in the Project
This project leverages various skills and knowledge areas, each applied to specific components to ensure smooth functionality and insightful results. Here's a breakdown of the key skills and where they are applied in the project:

- 1. Python Programming
    Used for: Writing the core scripts for data processing, interaction with the GitHub repository, MySQL database, and generating visualizations.
    Where used: Throughout the project, Python scripts handle tasks like cloning the GitHub repository, loading the data into the MySQL database, and 
    creating visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib.
- 2. Git and GitHub Integration
Used for: Cloning the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and maintaining version control.
Where used: The GitPython library is utilized to clone or update the PhonePe Pulse repository. This ensures that the latest data is always available for analysis, enabling the project to automatically keep track of changes in the GitHub repository.
- 3. Data Handling with Pandas
Used for: Data manipulation and transformation.
Where used: Pandas is used for reading, cleaning, and transforming the raw JSON data from the GitHub repository into a structured format suitable for analysis and database storage. It is also used for analyzing and preparing data before visualization.
- 4. MySQL Database Management
Used for: Storing, retrieving, and managing large datasets.
Where used: MySQL is used to store the data extracted from the PhonePe Pulse repository. The Python script connects to the MySQL database using the mysql.connector library, and queries are run to extract data dynamically for visualizations.
- 5. Data Visualization with Plotly and Matplotlib
Used for: Creating interactive and static visualizations like bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and geographical maps.
Where used: Plotly and Matplotlib are employed to generate detailed visualizations from the data. Plotly is particularly useful for creating interactive graphs that are embedded into the Streamlit dashboard, while Matplotlib is used for static plots.
- 6. Streamlit for Web-based Dashboards
Used for: Creating an interactive, user-friendly web dashboard for data visualization.
Where used: Streamlit is the primary framework used to build the web-based dashboard that allows users to explore and interact with the data visualizations directly from their web browser. The dashboard provides multiple dropdown options for filtering and viewing data.
- 7. GitPython
Used for: Automating the process of cloning or updating the GitHub repository.
Where used: The project uses GitPython to clone the PhonePe Pulse repository programmatically. It checks whether the repository already exists in the local directory and updates it accordingly to fetch the latest data.
- 8. Error Handling and Logging
Used for: Managing and troubleshooting errors that may occur during database connections, data fetching, or other processes.
Where used: The project incorporates logging and error-handling mechanisms to ensure that any issues during repository cloning, database interactions, or data processing are caught and logged for easy debugging.
- 9. Operating System (OS) Interaction
Used for: Setting environment variables and handling file paths.
Where used: The os module is used to manage environment variables such as Git's executable path and handle file system operations, ensuring smooth interactions between the Python script, Git, and the operating system.
- 10. SQL Queries
Used for: Extracting and querying specific data from the MySQL database.
Where used: SQL queries are executed from within the Python script to retrieve data from the MySQL database for analysis and visualization. This allows for filtering data by year, region, or other criteria, based on user input in the dashboard.

## Application in the Project
These skills are used in various components of the project as follows:

- Python and Pandas: Used to manipulate data retrieved from the GitHub repository and transform it into a structured format for storage and visualization.
- MySQL: Used to store the cleaned and structured data in tables, allowing for querying and retrieval at any point in time.
- Streamlit: Provides an easy-to-use dashboard for interacting with the visualized data, offering users real-time updates and insights.
- Plotly and Matplotlib: Responsible for creating the visual representations of the data, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.
- GitPython: Manages interaction with the PhonePe Pulse repository, ensuring the latest data is fetched and available for analysis.
- Error Handling: Ensures that issues with data retrieval, storage, and visualization are captured and logged for quick resolution.
