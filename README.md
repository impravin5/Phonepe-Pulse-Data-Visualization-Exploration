#PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The goal is to create a live geo-visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, providing users with insights and interactive visualizations through a browser-accessible interface. The data is securely stored and retrieved from a MySQL database.

#Approach
#Data Extraction

-Clone the GitHub repository containing PhonePe Pulse data using scripting.
-Store the data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON) for further processing.
#Data Transformation

-Use Python and Pandas to manipulate, clean, and preprocess the data.
-Handle missing values, format the data, and prepare it for analysis and visualization.
#Database Insertion

-Utilize mysql-connector-python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the cleaned data.
-Write SQL commands to create tables and insert the transformed data.
#Dashboard Creation

-Implement Streamlit and Plotly to create an interactive dashboard.
-Leverage Plotly's geo-map functions to visualize the data on a map.
-Use Streamlit to provide an intuitive interface with dropdown options for users to filter data.
#Data Retrieval

-Use mysql-connector-python to fetch data from the MySQL database into Pandas DataFrames.
-Ensure the dashboard updates dynamically based on the latest data.

#Results
The final result is a live geo-visualization dashboard that displays interactive insights from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. Key features include:

At least 10 dropdown filters to allow users to explore different metrics and statistics.
MySQL database storage for efficient data retrieval.
Dynamic updates reflecting the latest available data.
User-friendly interface accessible from a web browser.
This dashboard will provide valuable insights for data analysis and decision-making. It allows users to visualize trends, compare different states or regions, and easily interact with various data points. The visualizations, which include maps, bar charts, and pie charts, make it a comprehensive tool for exploring data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Python and its libraries for data extraction, transformation, and visualization. The dashboard serves as a user-friendly tool, enabling real-time exploration of PhonePe Pulse data. By integrating data from GitHub into a live, interactive visualization dashboard, this solution brings valuable insights to life, enhancing decision-making processes in the Fintech domain.
