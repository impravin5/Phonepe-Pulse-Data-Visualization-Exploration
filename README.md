## Introduction

The `PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis Project` is designed to clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, extract data, store it in a MySQL database, and visualize it using Python. The primary focus is to create an interactive web dashboard to explore transaction data, trends, and patterns across states and regions using Python libraries such as Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Features

- Clone and update the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
- Store extracted data in a MySQL database.
- Visualize data through interactive charts, graphs, and maps.
- Provide an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
- Easy navigation for exploring transaction data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting and data analysis.
- **GitPython**: To clone and interact with the PhonePe GitHub repository.
- **Pandas**: For data extraction, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **MySQL**: For storing and retrieving data.
- **Plotly & Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive web-based dashboard.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Git
- MySQL Server
- GitHub account for accessing the PhonePe Pulse data repository.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the PhonePe Pulse repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse.git
Install required Python libraries:

Navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Set up MySQL Database:
Create a MySQL database to store the data. Update the MySQL connection details in the phonepe.py file:

host = "localhost"
user = "root"
password = "your_password"
database = "phonepe_data"
Set the Git executable path (Windows users):

## Clone or update the PhonePe Pulse repository:

Run the phonepe.py script to clone the repository or verify if it exists. If the repository exists, it will be updated.

python phonepe.py
The data will be cloned to the specified directory and stored in the MySQL database for further analysis.

## Launch the Streamlit Dashboard:

The dashboard allows you to interact with the data and visualize trends, patterns, and insights. To run the dashboard:
streamlit run phonepe_dashboard.py

## Visualize Data:

Use the Streamlit dashboard to visualize the transaction data from the PhonePe Pulse repository. You can explore various transaction metrics across different states, districts, and time periods.

## Data Visualization
This project supports a variety of data visualizations, including:

- Bar Charts: Display aggregated data by categories such as states or districts.
- Line Charts: Analyze trends over time for different regions.
- Scatter Plots: Examine correlations between different metrics.
- Pie Charts: Show proportions of various transaction types.
- Geographical Maps: Explore transaction data across India's states using choropleth maps.
- These visualizations are interactive and help in gaining insights from the PhonePe Pulse data.
